# 📱 Teen Phone Addiction - Data Analysis Project

A data science project that explores the patterns, causes, and effects of phone addiction among teenagers using data-driven insights. This project involves end-to-end data analysis — from data cleaning to model building — aimed at uncovering actionable insights to understand and potentially address this modern-day concern.

## 📊 Project Overview

Teenage phone addiction is a growing issue in today's digital world. This project analyzes a dataset related to teenage phone usage, exploring how factors like age, gender, screen time, app usage, and mental health correlate with signs of addiction.

Key objectives include:
- Identifying behavioral patterns related to phone overuse.
- Understanding demographic trends.
- Visualizing relationships between screen time and mental health.
- Predictive modeling to classify or quantify addiction risk.

## 🧪 Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**
   Dataset used: *(Add source link or brief description)*

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

   * Handling missing values
   * Encoding categorical variables
   * Feature scaling

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Distribution analysis
   * Correlation heatmaps
   * Screen time vs mental health

4. **Modeling**

   * Regression or classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
   * Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)

5. **Insights & Conclusion**

   * Interpretation of results
   * Real-world implications and possible interventions

## 📌 Key Findings

* High screen time often correlates with self-reported anxiety and low sleep quality.
* Females aged 15–17 showed slightly higher phone dependence scores.
* Social media usage was the most significant factor in addiction prediction models.
